# Eggholder sample code

Modified version of the sample code for an evolutionary algorithm to find a
minimum on an "eggholder" surface.
Jupyter notebook to test code modifications.

Modifications:
* Child = mean of parents -> results in bias towards the center.
* Adjustable value for K.
* Selection in stead of evaluation.
